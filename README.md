# MSSQL Python Chatbot with GPT-3.5 and Mistral AI


## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses GPT-3.5 to interpret and respond to user queries in natural language.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Dynamically generates SQL queries based on the user's natural language input.
- **Database Interaction**: Connects to a SQL database to retrieve query results, demonstrating practical database interaction.
- **Streamlit GUI**: Features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, making it easy for users of all skill levels.
- **Python-based**: Entirely coded in Python, showcasing best practices in software development with modern technologies.

## Brief Explanation of How the Chatbot Works

The chatbot works by taking a user's natural language query, converting it into a SQL query using GPT-3.5, executing the query on a SQL database, and then presenting the results back to the user in natural language. This process involves several steps of data processing and interaction with the OpenAI API and a SQL database, all seamlessly integrated into a Streamlit application.
